# Niftynet Sampler 

This script shows examples of Niftynet sampler functions: Uniform, Balanced and weighted sampler.

## Prerequisites

Niftynet

## Running the tests

Execute the script and visualize the plots depending on the slice you want to visualize.

```
myshow(slice=30)
```

The Weighted patched sampled volume is saved as '..patchMask.mhd'. This volume can be visualized using a rendiring tool such as the one available on 3D slicer.
